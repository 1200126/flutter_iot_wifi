# flutter_iot_wifi_example

Demonstrates how to use the flutter_iot_wifi plugin.

## Getting Started

Replace `ssid` and `password` in main.dart with the WiFi AP you'd like to connect to. 

## iOS restrictions

Scan and List are not available for iOS. The recommended approach is to connect using prefix=true if you have a known ssid prefix.
